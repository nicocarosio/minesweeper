You will learn foundational JavaScript concepts that will set you up for success when you begin learning React.

This unit consists of twelve JavaScript. Each lesson covers one JavaScript topic and builds on the concepts from previous lessons.

Between lessons, you will use your new skills to write a piece of a JavaScript project on your own computer. The culmination of your efforts will result in a Minesweeper game that you can play from the command line.

Good luck on your first day of Building Web Applications with React!
